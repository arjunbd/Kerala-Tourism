      <p style=" text-align: justify;">Agasthyakoodam is nature’s ode to bird watchers. One of the highest peaks in Kerala, it has long been known as a bird watcher’s paradise and many gather here to catch sight of exotic avian species.  It can be viewed from near Neyyar Dam as well as Bonacaud. Agasthyakoodam is also known for its remarkable flora and fauna, especially certain rare medicinal herbs which have been discovered here. Over 2000 species including lichens, orchids, mosses and ferns have been recorded in the area.

        The peak was named after the sage Agasthya and is a popular pilgrim site. A shrine dedicated to him is located here and is frequented by devotees. The air itself is said to have medicinal qualities. The peak is a 90 minute drive with Bonacaud being the last motorable spot. Trekking is restricted as only a few people are allowed to go up the peak. One must get a forest pass from the wildlife office in Thiruvananthapuram with January to April being the recommended months.</p>

      <p style=" text-align: justify;">About 15 km from Munnar lies the famous Echo Point. Popular for its natural echo phenomenon, one can always see the area full of eager visitors throughout the year. At an altitude of about 600 ft, people love taking a walk in the lush greenery surrounding the place. It is an ideal picnic spot.

        People usually come across Echo Point while making the trip to Top Station, the highest point (1700m) in Munnar, on the Munnar-Kodaikanal road. Here the clouds seem like they are just an arm’slength away and one gets a brilliant view of the valley below. This is also a prime viewing spot for the Neelakurinji (Strobilantheskunthianus), flowers which bloom once every twelve years.
