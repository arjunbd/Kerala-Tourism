  <p style=" text-align: justify;">There are a number of popular wildlife sanctuaries in Kerala housing exotic and rare species of flora and fauna. Nestled in the elaborate forest of the majestic Western Ghats or Sahyadri Ranges in Kerala are  fourteen wildlife sanctuaries and two tiger reserves. Kerala also has six national parks containing protected and endangered species like the Indian Sloth-Bear, Lion-Tailed Macaque, Indian Bison, Bengal Tiger, Nilgiri Tahr etc.</p>

        <p style=" text-align: justify;">Munnar is among the crown jewels of God’s Own Country and has attracted visitors from around the world for centuries due to its natural splendour. Hidden inside, lies the famous Eravikulam National Park, the home and sanctuary of the Nilgiri Tahr. This sacred haven for this exotic animal is a relief in a time when different species are disappearing off the face of the planet. Situated in the Devikulam Taluk of Idukki district, people also flock to this park to view the special Neelakurinji flowers that bloom once every 12 years. The next sighting is expected to be in 2030.

          The park also boasts of hosting South India's highest peak, Anamudi (2695 m), in its southern area. This park is spread over an area of 97 square kilometers and packs tons of fun spots for people to have a good time in. One can see the crowds around the Echo Point, where the natural view and unique setting adds to the eponymous phenomenon. The Rajamalai region of the park is open to the public and from here; the exotic Nilgiri Tahr can be viewed. The Rajamalai region falls under the tourism zone of the area. The other two are the Core area and Buffer area which are both not open to the public. There is a host of trekking options as well in the area.
          
          The rare flora and fauna present in the park also attract visitors. Official vehicles take people on trips where one can experience the biodiversity of a high elevation shola-grassland system. One can view rare terrestrial and epiphytic orchids and beautiful wild balsams along with the Nilgiri Langur, leopards and the Indian Bison as well.</p>

        <p style=" text-align: justify;">Established in 1973, the Muthanga Wildlife Sanctuary is contiguous to the protected area network of Nagarhole and Bandipur of Karnataka on the north east and Mudumalai of Tamil Nadu on the southeast. Rich in bio-diversity, the sanctuary is an integral part of the Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve. The management lays emphasis on scientific conservation with due consideration for the general lifestyle of the tribals and others who live in and around the forest region. The Sanctuary has a large population of pachyderms and has been declared a Project Elephant site.

          Elephants roam freely here and tigers are sighted occasionally as well. Various species of deer, monkeys and birds also live here. The Reserve is also home to a profusion of birds, butterflies and insects. The trees and plants in the sanctuary are typical of the south Indian moist deciduous forests and semi-evergreen forests. A drive along the road to Muthanga and further, offers chances to watch these roaming animals. Elephant rides can be arranged by the Forest Department.  </p>
