    Backwater
</h1>
<br>
<p style="text-align:justify;">
    The scenic backwaters of Kerala comprise serene stretches of lakes, canals and lagoons located parallel to the coast of the Arabian Sea. The backwater regions of Kerala are one of the most popular tourist destinations in the world. The tranquil backwater cruises are a once in a lifetime experience. Alappuzha, known as the 'Venice of the East', is especially popular for its houseboat cruises where you can soak in nature at its finest form.

        <p style="text-align:justify">Referred to as the Venice of the East, Alappuzha has always enjoyed an important place in the maritime history of Kerala. Today, it is famous for its boat races, backwater holidays, beaches, marine products and coir industry. Alappuzha Beach is a popular picnic spot. The pier, which extends out to the sea here, is over 137 years old. Entertainment facilities at the Vijaya Beach Park add to the attraction of the beach. There is also an old lighthouse nearby which greatly intrigues all visitors.

            Another delightful experience while in Alappuzha is the houseboat cruise. The houseboats you find in the backwaters of Alappuzha are in fact a reworked version of the Kettuvallams of olden times. Kettuvallam is a Malayalam word, ‘Kettu’, refers to dwelling structures and ‘Vallom’ means boat. In the olden days, kettuvallam or boat with thatched roof that covers over wooden hulls was used to carry tons of rice and spices. 
            
            Of late, houseboats come equipped with all the comforts of a good hotel room including furnished bedrooms, modern toilets, cozy living rooms, a kitchen and even a balcony for angling. An uninterrupted view of life in the backwaters can be enjoyed while staying in a houseboat.</p>

        <p style="text-align:justify">Kavvayi Kayal is among the most fascinating backwater destinations in Kerala. This lesser known destination is the result of the five rivers viz. River Kavvayi and its tributary streams Kankol, Vannathichal, Kuppithodu, and Kuniyan. Kavvayi refers to a collection of small islands connected to Payyannur in Kannur by a bridge. It has been bestowed with many a natural gift and is considered among the most exotic locations in North Kerala.

            These backwaters form the biggest wetland in north Kerala with an area of roughly 37 sq km. Boat rides provide one with the opportunity to watch the simple villagers go about their daily duties diligently. One comes across rare flora and fauna regularly. The boat rides will also help you explore each of the different islands. One can also indulge in delicious seafood in the area. It is the perfect place to visit for some well-deserved peace and relaxation. The breeze alone will calm your soul.</p>

          <p style="text-align:justify">Kumbalangi Integrated Tourism Village Project is a unique initiative to transform the tiny island of Kumbalangi into a model fishing village and tourism spot. It is the first of its kind in India and is located in Kochi. It is blessed with many natural wonders and the people who visits are treated to many a rare treat.

            Kumbalangi is surrounded by backwaters.  Chinese Fishing Nets cover the island and the village boasts of rich aquatic life. An array of mangroves separate land from water and provide for a good breeding ground for prawns, crabs, oysters and small fish.
            
            Palluruthy nearby is coming up in a similar manner. This hamlet provides a close glimpse of the simple lifestyle of villagers who still live by traditions that have been passed down for centuries.
            
            Kalagramam is an artist’s village that displays fishing equipment and handicrafts. Bait-fishing is extremely popular among tourists here. Many houses in the village are homestays and visitors can book their stay directly with homestay operators.</p>
