   <p style=" text-align: justify;"> Our rich history is a source of pride for every Keralite. The cultural and artistic lessons that have been passed down are of utmost importance to us. It is our heritage and hence across the state we have centers built to honor and preserve these traditions. From the Stone Age carvings of Edakkal caves to Kalamandalam, a University for performing arts, the teachings of our elders still thrive in modern day Kerala. Their gifts to us shall never be forgotten and each new generation adds its own input to the same. Come visit these locations for an insight into the legacy of the state.</p>

        <div class="col-sm-8">
          <p style=" text-align: justify;">Visitors to Pathanamthitta district are never really sure of what to expect from Aranmula. This is mostly due to the lore surrounding this exotic village, famous for the genius of its craftsmen and the ancient vibe one experiences the moment oneenters. Aranmula is famous for its Aranmula Kannadi (metal mirrors), the centuries’ old Sree Krishna Temple, the unique ritualistic feast of `Vallasadya,’ and famed Aranmula Boat Race and the list goes on.

            It gets its name from the centuries-old Aranmula Parthasarathy Temple (dedicated to Sree Krishna) on the banks of the holy River Pamba, a virtual hotbed of devotees. The murals, carvings and paintings here have inspired much awe and interest. It is also the venue for the Aranmula Vallasadya, a ritual offering to the deity Lord Parthasarathy in which the oarsmen of the snake boats are offered a feast. With over 70 dishes it is probably one of the largest vegetarian feasts in India. (Watch the video of Vallasadya)
            
            Its legendary Vijnana Kalavedi houses some of the finest classes and teachers for a variety of art forms like Kathakali, classical dances, classical music and Kalaripayattu. Visitors can stay here for an extended period and observe the ancient crafts being passed on diligently to the next generation. 
            
            A trip is never complete without obtaining one of its special metal mirrors- the beautiful Aranmula Kannadi. From being gorgeous souvenirs to exquisite wedding gifts, these are unique to this locale and haven't yet been replicated anywhere else in the world. </p>
